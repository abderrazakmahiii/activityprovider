Dear teacher,

First, I would like to appologize for the work that I have done during topic 5 as I was sick for several weeks until this weekend as it was hard for me to maintain a balance between work, study and personal life. Attached, you can find the medical certificate.

As a summary of what I did:

1. I tried to do again topic 5 and implement a structure pattern in a picture of the Facade pattern as the Learning Platform can leverage the facade pattern to provide a simplified interface for interacting with the various components of the system, including the AwarenessAgent, Teacher, Student, and Course Management System. This pattern involves creating a single, unified interface that encapsulates the complexity of the underlying components, making it easier for users to interact with the system.

2. Choosing the Facade pattern was due to its simplicity as it provides a straightforward interface that hides the underlying complexity of the system, encapsulation as it protects the internal details of the system components from external users, a centralized control that serves as a single point of entry for accessing the system's functionality, maintainability as it improves the maintainability of the system by abstracting away internal details and its modular Design that allows for independent development and testing of system components.

3. For the diagrams, please find the diagrams of the previous topic below:

4. For the current topic, I used the chain of responsibility as my behaviour pattern, this way, the Activity Provider can leverage the chain of responsibility pattern to distribute the task of recommending activities based on different criteria. This pattern involves creating a chain of handlers, each responsible for handling specific types of recommendations and that will help the awareness agent to not have an excessive overload with data.

5. In the folder "Behaviour pattern diagrams", please find the diagrams of the current topic.

6. Note that I didn't delete the previous files from the code to have an idea about the change that has been made and I have added 15 files:

6.1 AwarenessAgent.js: Uses the chain of responsibility pattern to handle insights, ensuring that insights are processed effectively and efficiently.

6.2 AwarenessAgentFacade.js: Handles interactions with the AwarenessAgent, including sharing courses, tracking student progress, and generating insights.

6.3 CourseData.js: Represents the data structure for storing course information, providing a consistent format for course data representation.

6.4 CourseManagementSystem.js: The file represents the component responsible for managing student enrollments and course data. It encapsulates the complexities of interacting with the external Course Management System (CMS) and provides a simplified interface for the Learning Platform.

6.5 CourseManagementSystemFacade.js: Handles interactions with the Course Management System, including managing student enrollments and course data.

6.6 HandlerInterface.js: Defines the Handler interface for handling insights, ensuring consistency and modularity for insight processing.

6.7 Insight.js: Represents the data structure for storing insights generated by the AwarenessAgent, providing a consistent format for insight representation.

6.8 LearningAssistantHandler.js: Handles forwarding insights to the Learning Assistant for additional support, enabling personalized assistance for students.

6.9 LearningPlatformFacade.js: Provides a simplified interface for interacting with the learning platform, encapsulating the complexities of underlying components.

6.10 QueueHandler.js: Implements the Handler interface, managing a queue of insights to prevent overloading the AwarenessAgent.

6.11 Student.js The file represents the component responsible for representing student information and providing methods for accessing course content and submitting feedback. It encapsulates the student's enrolled courses and progress information.

6.12 StudentFacade.js: Handles interactions with the Student, including accessing course content and providing feedback.

6.13 StudentProgressData.js: Represents the data structure for storing student progress information, providing a consistent format for student progress data representation.

6.14 Teacher.js: The file represents the component responsible for representing teacher information and providing methods for sharing courses and receiving insights. It encapsulates the teacher's courses and insights received from the AwarenessAgent.

6.15 TeacherFacade.js: Handles interactions with the Teacher, including sharing courses and receiving insights.

6.16 TeacherHandler.js: Handles forwarding insights to the Teacher for review and action, ensuring timely delivery to educators.
